This late patch release addresses a large number of issues and adds several
new features. It is planned to be the last update to [Tiled 1.10][tiled-1.10],
with the focus now shifting towards the next release.

### Custom Project Properties

It is now possible to set custom properties on the project, in the Project
Properties dialog. This can come in handy when extensions need to be
configured with parameters.

### Scripting API Additions

Several noteworthy scripting API additions were made. Scripts can now [open
file dialogs][promptOpenFile] and [edit tile layers using
terrain][TileLayerWangEdit]. Also, a [Geometry interface][Geometry] was added
with functions to obtain points on a line or ellipse, or creating an ellipse
region.

### Godot 4

The [Godot 4 export plug-in][export-tscn] was extended with support for
exporting custom tile properties as "[Custom Data Layers][Custom Data
Layers]". If the exporter still doesn't do everything you expect from it, be
sure to also check out [YATI][YATI] (Yet Another Tiled Importer) for Godot 4.

### Universal macOS Binary

The macOS 10.14+ release is now a Universal Binary. This does double its size,
but it should improve performance for people on Apple Silicon. There have also
been [reports](https://discourse.mapeditor.org/t/it-cant-work-well-on-apple-m1-pro-monterey/5814)
of Tiled freezing on M1 and M2 chips and the hope is that this might resolve
that problem. Please be sure to let us know whether it does!
