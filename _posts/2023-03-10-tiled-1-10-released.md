Restored file format compatibility, quick action search, Godot 4 export and many scripting API additions are just some of the many small improvements in this release!

### Restored Compatibility with Tiled 1.8

In [Tiled 1.9][], the `type` attribute was renamed to `class` as part of [unifying custom types][], mostly for consistency reasons. This compatibility breakage continued to cause trouble months after that release, even with an option available in the Project Properties to save files using the Tiled 1.8 format. This is why this change has been reverted in Tiled 1.10. Of course, there is now a "Tiled 1.9" compatibility version for those who's project relies solely on the `class` attribute.

### Action Search Pop-up

A handy addition is the new "Search Actions" pop-up (aka. "Command Palette" in other apps), which can be triggered with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>. It makes it easy to find most available menu and tool bar actions and makes them quickly available using just the keyboard.

Thanks to [@dogboydog](https://github.com/dogboydog/) for getting this feature started!

### Godot 4 Export Plug-in

[Godot 4.0](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/) just released and [@Skrapion](https://github.com/Skrapion) has been working on a new Tiled plug-in that can export a map to a Godot `.tscn` file. It currently supports all map orientations, tile flipping, collisions and animations, but still lacks support for object layers and image collection tilesets.

Alternatively, there is also a [Tiled Importer for Godot 4](https://github.com/Kiamo2/YATI) available, with a very extensive feature set.

### Automapping Changes

In Automapping rules, it is possible to define multiple output options for randomization purposes. So far, these options each had equal probability. It is now possible to specify the probability of an output index using a custom [`Probability`][automapping probability] property on one of its output layers.

Locked layers are no longer affected by Automapping rules by default. The new [`IgnoreLock`][IgnoreLock] option can be used to make rules that ignore layer locks.

To improve compatibility with old Automapping rules, the presence of any "regions" layer now makes [`MatchInOrder`][MatchInOrder] default to `true`.

Finally, the [Automapping documentation](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/automapping/) got a big update thanks to [eishiya](http://eishiya.com/), with new examples based on the improvements shipped in [Tiled 1.9][] and 1.10. 

### Object Fill and Application Font

A new custom class option was added to disable drawing the fill for certain shape objects. Useful for when the fill is getting in the way, for example when marking large areas or view boundaries.

An option has been added to the Theme preferences to set a custom application font.

### Scripting API Additions

Based on continuous feedback from people developing [Tiled extensions](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/scripting/), this release ships with many small additions. For example, it is now possible to render a map to an image using [`TileMap.toImage`][TileMap.toImage] and there are functions for handling [compression][] and [Base64 encoding][Base64]. You can also easily check the Tiled version using [`tiled.versionLessThan`][tiled.versionLessThan]. Scripts now also have initial access to the project through [`tiled.projectFilePath`][tiled.projectFilePath].

### Upgrade to Qt 6

After fixing a number of remaining issues with Tiled compiled against Qt 6, the releases for all platforms have now been updated from Qt 5.15.2 to Qt 6.4.2. This brings Tiled back to a supported Qt version and means some bugs may be fixed and some new ones could appear.

It also means the main downloads now require at least macOS 10.14, Ubuntu 20.04 (or equivalent distribution) or Windows 10. For compatibility with older systems (down to macOS 10.12, Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 7), additional Qt 5 based packages are [available on GitHub][github releases].
