Apart from fixing a number of issues in [Tiled 1.10][tiled-1.10], this release
adds read-only access to parts of the loaded project and improves the
interaction of panning with <kbd>Space</kbd>. The latter now requires the left
mouse button to be pressed as well, and now also works in the tileset view.

For Linux users, note that the Qt 5 AppImage no longer works on Ubuntu 18.04
since it is now built on Ubuntu 20.04 and requires Glibc 2.30. Users of Ubuntu
18.04 can still install the latest Tiled through [snap][snap] or
[Flatpak][Flatpak]. The snap has now also been updated to Qt 5.15 and the
Flatpak for 1.10.1 will use Qt 6.4.
